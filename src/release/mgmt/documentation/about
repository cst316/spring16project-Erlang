WHAT IS MEMORANDA?

Memoranda is a personal tool for scheduling and organizing projects.

Memoranda is for users who share work across different projects.

This tool accomplishes the following:
	
	- To be able to access multiple projects in one place. Projects
	  can be browsed, edited, created and removed if they are outdated.
	  
	- To be able to look over and edit the project's documentation.
	
	- Have check-lists for tasks at a certain duration of time.
	
	- Access and add resources that would help the project.
	
In the latest version of Memoranda (2.0), an emphasis on making the tool
more useful to programmers and software developers was needed. To address
that need, a tab for the Personal Software Process (PSP) was added.

In the PSP tab:
	
	- Project descriptions and the parties involved can be declared. 
	  Time estimates at each phase of the process can also be added.
	  
	- Designs for the project can be sketched and exported for future
	  use. The size of each component of the project can be declared
	  at the coding phase.
	  
	- As a user further progresses during a project, defects found 
	  along the way can also be declared. 
	
	- Finally, once the project is finished, a summary is generated
	  that displays all the estimates and actual values at each phase.
